## Project Description
Running an ice cream parlor may seem simple, but it faces several hidden challenges that affect both operations and customer satisfaction. Without a centralized system, managing orders often leads to mistakes and delays, while tracking perishable ingredients is error-prone and can result in wasted stock or shortages of popular flavors. In addition, staff scheduling and coordination during peak hours can be difficult, and customers lack an easy way to see available flavors, promotions, or personalized recommendations. These issues reduce efficiency, increase costs, and make it harder to deliver a smooth and enjoyable customer experience.

This project is developing a website, which would be the solution to the challenges mentioned above, for a local ice cream parlor only. The online menu on the site will not only display the flavors available on the spot but also the prices and promotions for customers to plan their visits in a more convenient way. Customers will also be empowered to make their orders online, which would be brought to them without having to wait, thus, eliminating any waiting time and minimizing the possibility of making mistakes in their orders. On the back-end, the system will be the support for inventory management as it will keep track of the usage of ingredients and their expiration dates, plus staff management will be there to ensure that there are always enough staff on duty during the busiest hours. Through the integration of customer-facing and operational tools, the solution is achieved, and it provides a smooth experience for both customers along with the staff.
