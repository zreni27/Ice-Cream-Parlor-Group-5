## Project Description
Running an ice cream parlor may seem simple, but it faces several hidden challenges that affect both operations and customer satisfaction. Without a centralized system, managing orders often leads to mistakes and delays, while tracking perishable ingredients is error-prone and can result in wasted stock or shortages of popular flavors. In addition, staff scheduling and coordination during peak hours can be difficult, and customers lack an easy way to see available flavors, promotions, or personalized recommendations. These issues reduce efficiency, increase costs, and make it harder to deliver a smooth and enjoyable customer experience.
